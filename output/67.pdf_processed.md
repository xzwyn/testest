## SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT

## Ladies and Gentlemen,

In the financial year 2024, another very successful year for Allianz, the Supervisory Board comprehensively fulfilled its duties and obligations as laid out in the company's statutes and applicable law. It monitored the activities of the company's Board of Management, addressed the succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and advised the Board of Management on business management issues.

## Overview

In the financial year 2024, the Supervisory Board held six ordinary meetings. Following the elections to the Supervisory Board, an additional constituent meeting was held upon the close of the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2024. The ordinary meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December. All meetings were held as in-person meetings.

At all meetings held in the financial year under review, the Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board about the development of business at Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. In particular, the Board of Management presented the development of Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments. The Board of Management provided comprehensive information about the development of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, including the planning as well as deviations of actual business developments from the planning. In this context, the Board of Management also regularly discussed the adequacy of capitalization, the solvency ratio of Allianz SE and the Group, and the corresponding stress and risk scenarios with the Supervisory Board. The annual and consolidated financial statements, including the respective auditor's reports, the half-year report as well as quarterly earnings releases, were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.

In addition to the impact of rising interest rates and geopolitical developments on the overall economy and the insurance sector, the reports and deliberations once again focused on a range of strategic topics, including the sales strategy and the strategy for the Asset Management business segment, as well as the Board of Management's planning for the financial year 2025. The effects and management of the risks of natural disasters were the subject of reports at several meetings of the full Supervisory Board and the committees. The Supervisory Board also dealt with the amendments to the dividend policy proposed by the Board of Management. The status of the digitalization of business processes and data privacy issues, particularly in connection with the legal framework for the use of artificial intelligence, were also discussed in detail. Other items discussed included cyber risk and IT security. As usual, the Supervisory Board also dealt extensively with personnel matters relating to the Board of Management as well as succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The deliberations of the Supervisory Board and in particular the Personnel Committee and Sustainability Committee also included establishing target achievement and setting targets for the remuneration of the Board of Management and revising the remuneration system for the Board of Management.

The Supervisory Board received regular, timely and comprehensive reports from the Board of Management. The Board of Management's oral reports at the meetings were prepared with written documents, sent to each member of the Supervisory Board in good time before the relevant meeting. The Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board in writing about important events, including between meetings. The Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management held regular discussions about key developments and decisions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board held separate talks with each member of the Board of Management on each individual's status of target achievement, both for the respective half year and the full year.

Once again in 2024, individual and group training sessions were held on the basis of a development plan adopted for the further training of the members of the Supervisory Board, for example on the internal model for determining the solvency ratio and on the amended accounting principles in accordance with IFRS 9 and 17. The new members of the Supervisory Board received comprehensive support from the company during their induction.

## Issues discussed in the Supervisory Board plenary sessions

At the meeting on 22 February 2024, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively with the preliminary business figures for the financial year 2023.

In the further course of the meeting, the Board of Management reported on the progress made in implementing the Allianz Business Master Platform in the Group. The Board of Management also reported on the strategy with regard to the increasing risks from natural disasters and on Allianz's debt financing. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed the target achievement of the individual members of the Board of Management and, on that basis, set their variable remuneration for the financial year 2023, subject to the approval of the annual financial statements. As part of the performance assessment, the Supervisory Board carried out a Fit & Proper assessment of the members of the Board of Management, and it was determined that there was no reason to apply the compliance caveat in paying variable remuneration components. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board conducted the sustainability review required for the payment of the LTI tranche allocated for the financial year 2019 and determined that there were no objections to the corresponding payments either. The Supervisory Board also set the outstanding targets for variable remuneration for the Board of Management for the financial year 2024.
